Kaggle Playground Series Hub
Overview
Welcome to the Kaggle Playground Series Hub! 🚀 This repository serves as a central hub for the Kaggle Playground Series competition, where I share my code and solutions for each series. The goal is to explore, learn, and collaborate on various machine learning challenges presented in Kaggle's Playground.

Series Progress
Season 3, Episode 26 (S3E26): Hyperparameter Tuning 🕵️‍♂️🚀
 Initial model training with XGBoost and Random Forest.
 Handling missing values and encoding categorical features.
 Incorporating hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV for XGBoost.
 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for S3E26 (Coming soon!)
How to Navigate
Each series will have its dedicated folder, making it easy to find and review the code. Feel free to explore, provide feedback, and join the discussion!

Note
I haven't posted the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for S3E26 yet, but I'll be sharing it soon. Stay tuned for the latest updates!

Happy coding! 🚀📊✨
